2024-10-03 12:11:53,071 - minutememo_app.app - INFO - Final transcription result for session ID 162: We have done a lot of actions on it, and there are no structural KPIs yet, but there is already a meeting about feedback, and then there is the budget for 2022, which we have already received. Last month, the challenges and initiatives were focused on tight pipeline hygiene. And everything is running together, so the logging is tighter. At the end of the month, it is a bit more extensive, because a lot has come in and so on. But we have the dashboards together with Thomas, and you will see that this month. We have sat together a lot, we have looked at a lot together, and we have micromanaged a bit more than we did before. The pressure has increased, which gave a bit of pushback to the team. But in the end, we saw an effect of it. For us, an effect of it was the SQ1 opportunity ratio. At the end of the month, it went down a bit more. That is a typical effect that we see. But I understand that we have to keep the extra pressure. A number of initiatives that we are going to take now should make it structural. Thank you for the interview. It is a very nice story. I said, Thomas, you are in our story. It is okay, you are in our story. We are not sure what is going to happen next. What can we do to make it easier for everyone to look at it? Yesterday, we had a meeting to increase efficiency in a hub spot. Among other things, there was one thing that happens a lot. The following up of the customers. Trying to get contact. We are working on that now. Sequences and also planning meetings. That is something completely new that we are doing here. How did we start with that? And he has had success with that. We will get into that later. But everything is a bit together. Logging and monitoring as well. The phones are being listened to. As agreed. We had our first meeting to discuss the findings. It is a bit different from what we already found. It was a general feedback. The discovery call was not done. Or within the sales. Koen does a discovery call. Anthony does it without him knowing. A kind of discovery. We got a nice takeaway from that. That Koen already applies. And says, I already book results with that. You will get into that later. Data driven quick actions. Leading KPIs. We had a meeting about that last week. We try to do more leading KPIs every week. I have a better understanding of that. And the last one, the Payments Average, compared to Bjorn. I did not do that. Yes, that's good. So we have a whole list. You have already seen it. Of action points we have taken. Thomas and I would like to sit together again. To see where we want to move forward. What we need to adjust. Thomas also took the initiative for a Q4. To have a meeting between the two of us. We have not had that yet. But we are going to do that this week. To see how we can make a difference. There are a number of points we would like to bring up. To you. Also with Bjorn Gespart. About that. This month. Do you have a full month? So, with that you will see. Oh, I was looking at the wrong one. Sorry. I was looking here. My apologies. I thought we were going through the room. With that you will see. Very good. Last month was a very strong month. The company performance is at 102% of the budget. For closed bond deals. And then about the euro we are at 141%. If we look at your business. It has a direct effect. It will certainly have had an effect. From the initiative we took. Last week. Sorry, last month. Our goal was 41%. We achieved 40%. But our initial goal was 36%. So those four are a step up. Now we also realize that for the quarter. We have to average 7 per month. 8. We have to average 8 per month. So we are at the beginning of the ... It's going to ... But hey. Let's talk about it. Last month. Close to your business. Deals. 110%. And close to the payment. 118%. And for the rest. Almost everywhere. Target also achieved. Referral 100%. Except ... Is that right? Bjorn? 10K compared to 31? Or something like that? No. I'm sorry. It's 150 or 200,000. Yes, okay. 160. 160. I'll check that. Partial performance. Green. Down the line. And then existing business. Has achieved euros target. But not in the number of deals. Yes. Are there any questions about that? Or not? Yes, but ... Could you let me know in advance ... Of course you had to negotiate with him before that. I will get these information later. Oh. Most lightly. All relations are not all right. I could not make that. That is scumbag for the rest of the world. Shouldn't we give that as the approach? Yes. That will also have to wait. I would say that the extensions are not optimistic. They are not bad either. For this reason, I do not say both of them if they are good or bad. They are very clear on their majesty's side. No. To be frank, they would have been more competent and who they either were or not, because it has not been officially clarified on behalf of British law and the influence of the volumes. I am certain, although not all is in full play, rather it has a somewhat Evidence Theory. In recent years, I have always Kick Randall in arising in theory and
and the balloons that we have blown up Focus on sales Sales Incentive Whatever Those are the two F's Are you a plant contender? Really? Are you a plant contender? Who is a plant contender? I... We are constantly collecting I also don't want him to give me more leads if the ratios are not what they should be For example, yesterday Thomas sent me some reports which show that the ratios when Yannick was here are indeed higher than Coen But the number of leads that Coen handles are twice as many as Yannick So there is a curve in the number of leads that you can handle The close rates can remain stable but if you get too many, they will decrease And I think we need to find a good balance there That's why a hire is still very important French-speaking leads are half of PKW I think we saw that before, if I'm not mistaken Yes, PKW is half So if we can take that away You have a candidate who comes for partnerships I also got someone on Friday through new recruitment offices that we got The film is coming out tonight Yes, it's coming out tonight How many books do you have now? I don't know I just saw a chapter Too many? Yes, too many There is about 40% behind that film For sales and all For operations Yes, maybe a month I sent them I followed them I even sent them again It's not a thousand percent I think it's 100% You know that, of course I do It's in conversion then Yes, conversion But in number it was... Yes, yes, yes We already got a number But it's in bookkeeping Okay, that's fine Okay, good So, until next time Well done Very well done, actually We are all looking forward to it In the film we did not reach the volume of LKW&L, LKW&R and LKW&L Quality was also not enough and that's why I think on my side LKW&E, LKW&L and LKW&R We still have to work on that A double-edged sword against a double-edged sword that brings scalability and makes us go well Management of local publishers has still not been picked up And Correcting this Excel with an error like we did last time we still haven't done that And then experimenting experimenting with AutoScout I think at the moment we have at the moment we have Yes, what does that say? Yes, but hopefully that will be available soon That's it Those are all the experiments that we... that we have in our budget at the moment And it's better that we know now because next year our budget will be tested So volume and quality research LKW&E based on more volume next year The next QL is the QL Travel Target Print So actually we started this quarter to do more volume to do more research We will do the same volume as in September But the rest, like this one for a year QL, QL, QL Travel Target That too The objective of Q3 is to make sure that in the next year you will have enough Q3 and you don't have to do it Let's say trust in data reporting processes, workflows with me, if it's with me in a few months, maybe more Let's say Robin eats a lot a lot of taloon in the air He even has little things that he has to fix once and fix once and then that program comes along and he has it You miss the space and time to make an overview Where are my leaking buckets everywhere and how do I get rid of them every day And I'm going to put that out there depending on the next year I'm going to give some feedback in Q3 about when it comes to processes and so on It hasn't been shown yet but it will be out soon Hans is busy with his store which will start soon so there will be a lot of time I think I'm not going to be there for a long time But what I find lately is that there are a lot of systems that don't know where to put it You can just put it here it's simple, you can adjust it and then you win, Robin For a simple device you can't say anything about it and you can't say Robin, you have a lot of money and you can't say anything about it because it's a simple device You have to ask about it on Facebook You have to ask about it on Facebook so you can fix it It's a simple procedure but it's not going to be easy It's such a situation that Robin and I have to be busy What else do I want to say? Nothing Also everything about Mercury on Quarturas a lot has come to me and it's nice to be in the light but you're also in the light at night and then you're in the dark But it's also like this It's going to take time but the more processes that you build the more people you need The more codes you write the more people you need in your IT team to keep testing So I think for next year Robin might need someone who will be ready who will be good in terms of team building So, of course we have to take this into account and our strategy is to spread it Yes, but a lot of times too many staff a process that is linked to another process so if you look at it we are looking at how Robin will look at integrating in the total organization That's why if you ask Robin how to build something he will say if we can build something in a week then we can build something that the two of us can do That's why we need Robin Yes, let's continue So an action point is if you don't have a good idea It's more than a project For me it's more sales and marketing processes Yes, yes, I understand And then you have to make a price Yes, and next year we will have to look at that with Hans We have a part on medical employment and finance that we have to look at I don't think I'm going to go into the medical plan No We have a technical plan and we just did it in 20 re-planning we really need to change all the final visualizations and we have to make sure that we have a timeline so that we can do it What is the timeline for January? Internally this month then with the move in December so that everyone gets the drugs so that everyone is a saver Saver and then in January the communication on the outside is done and that the fans are familiar Alright That's the plan and the new plan I mean it's a bit short Yes What about the customer What are you talking about? What are you talking about? What are you talking about?
How is that possible? No, no, I have... I have... I have noticed that I am very close to my newest version of HubSpot, but because of... problems with the language, because my password can't be found in the language box, I have very quickly moved it into the system that I wanted to bring to the client. I think that's pretty good, but language-wise, I don't think so. I don't have any other no-go solution, and that's why we didn't have it in time. But in hindsight, I have seen a party that does the tracking of everything, from the website to the customer port, and then the customer port and then the data. I do think that when we discovered the idea that it's necessary, that we now have a customer port, we didn't have a sales portal or anything like that. No, I think we already have... I already have... But I do think that... Yes, we are still in the process of planning this and I think it's important that we have a customer portal and that we can launch new things, so that we can connect with each other. Yes, that's a good point. And I think that the user concept has a very extreme programming. Yes. It's a bit complicated. But I think it's a good idea. I think it's a good idea, but I don't think we can do anything about it. A customer port is very basic. You can download it and upload it with data or something. I would think about it, but I don't think we can do anything about it. I would think about it, but I don't think we can do anything about it. I would think about it, but I don't think we can do anything about it. We can take it as a starting point, a customer portal, a general key company, but in the next few days, we will decide. Yes. Alright. Yes, we are the Jesus for new business. We had a very strong month. There were three of Björn, but even without the three of Björn, we reached a point where it's still too short. I have to say that when I look at the team itself, Gilles did a very nice inhale in the last week. He's a bit behind compared to the third week. Anthony had a very strong month and what we notice there is that his sales cycle is much longer. So he keeps his deals much longer and we notice that he's a good nurturer. And Koen... Koen, you did that inhale there. We still notice that sometimes some deals fall out of the boat. So that's the effect of having too many leads. The quarter is achieved, so that's positive, but we still have a lot left for the year. And Spiv brought a good vibe to the community. They said it themselves. Even though they say it's just stupid balloons. But it helps to have a balloon. The challenges then... There has been a lot of pressure for a month on the team, because of the target that was raised. I shot a bit more in action in terms of monitoring and so on. That has had some side effects. They had an intervention with me to tell me that it's all in good order now. So it's not just because it's busy. They also think that I'm going to have more hair on my teeth. So those are a few things that have been raised that I know. A big challenge is how we can maintain that vibe. We talked about it last week. How do we maintain that momentum? It's nice, but it's something that we can't always do. Especially in 2. If they become dependent on Spiv, they will wait for Spiv before they start performing. We want to find a way to maintain that vibe and the momentum of last week. It's going well this week. If it's a good performance, I think it creates momentum. We have a few ideas that we want to work on. Especially that we launch Spiv. But that's a different topic. For me, the challenges and initiatives for this month. To maintain the process better. It's about the deals that are closed through the whole funnel to the delivery. I have a report every morning about that. Partially paid. We talk about that every day. They get that every morning. We make sure that they follow the process from the beginning. Also about how the deals go through the funnel. In the meeting room, you will see a flowchart. Koen made that. Very strong. We discussed a few things. What comes first? What is our quick win? To win time with the reps. For example, the automation in sequences and calendar meetings. Framework. That's a part of the challenges. They have to offer a clear framework of what they can do. Last month, Björn and I discussed how to handle that. I sometimes think it's too complicated. To make it easier. It's complicated now. I will not interfere with that. I get to see them every morning. My tool sends them to me. For the rest, we play around with pricing. Personal development. Telephony monitoring. Last week, we had a good team meeting. We worked on what I believe will have an impact. Focusing on Rio is a big one. We will apply the Pizzagerman story. We parked it. We want to improve the conditions. In that context, we will work with Gilles. To make sure that the communication or discovery will be better. It's in the grid now. It's in the grid now. Momentum. One of the initiatives we talked about that we believe will have an impact on closing and on the close rates is the introduction of a business case. Bjorn challenged us on that. The idea would be to try it on LKW. Bjorn suggested to buy LKW's in bulk. So we can get a discount. The discount will cover the negative idea. Of course, we want to meet the success criteria. We will try it for a month. We know it will have an effect on the close one rate, on the number of deals and on the cash. It will have a positive effect. Tomas calculated that if we would get 4 or 5 deals more on LKW's, our cash will be better than €1000. If we would focus only on LKW's, our cash would have a bigger impact. I'm a bit sad because I don't know what to say. I would like to thank you. You told a lot. I don't have a concrete action or initiative for you. For next month? Yes. That's a list of Peter Kentz. Ah, ok. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know
I think, my feeling is, maybe I can also go to Thomas, that it will not be concrete. Just not, because it might be too complicated for me. It's not too complicated, it's too concrete. No, indeed. I'm a big fan of that. But I believe it will be better, more concrete. But do you hear from others? Right. If they have to buy a stick every week, will they be able to do it the next morning? It's a difficult question. Let's put it in the plan. It's a difficult answer. A difficult answer to the question of how we are going to make sure that this quarter we can make an extra effort. It's an answer to that, that we're looking for. We're actually looking at your journal practice in two separate chapters. And I think that, you're doing 8,000, even strictly with the technical side. But I think your journal practice, from there on, you have to work on your journal. So you can see that you can do it differently. You can do it by getting value porting. And number two is, that you can work on that. So it's a very good question. I think it's a stable program. Yes, last week it was a bit of a mess. But now it's a bit better. Do you want to go on, or do you want to sit at the table again and present it again to Peter? It's not a monthly thing, is it? No, no, no. These are all initiatives that we take to see that we have an extra... I would like to see it together. We've been working on it for a month now. We're going to give you a little bit now. Okay, good. Yes? Johan. Hi, I'm Rob. I'm going to go on for a while. We're going to take a look at the numbers in a moment. First of all, I don't have a lot of time. That's on the target. You can do your best. I added the year-to-date. We still think it's a Euro-scientific example. And so do we here. So if it's good, it's good for all events this year. Then you can see what we're doing. The existing business on target. I don't get much from this. I've only seen 20 tasks here. But 25 tasks that we've worked on. That would have been 11 people who would have been here this month. But the year-to-date, we're actually a bit ahead on that. So I don't have much time for that. Head-to-partnerships. I proposed a plan of action in mid-August. So that wasn't the most concrete. That's not my best article either. But it's a bit of a side project. I did some research. I've been in touch with Proofreads. We've said that we're going to take all files at 20 percent. And I think that's about 25 percent now. So that means we're just getting a new BKB. That's already 23 percent. We're going to test up to 120 percent. If we had generated more volume, I think that would have been a bit of a defensive exercise. But it's too much for that to be easy. If that's the case, it would be a great success. 1,500 commissions. That's already a percentage. We have an extra incentive for a staff of 100,000 euros per shift. If they want to join us, they can pay 1,200 euros extra. Factor 1. The commitment was to do another million from the beginning of September. But we have a mid-September proposal. It doesn't matter. So that's 50 percent of the pot. So we have to budget that. And that's 20,000 euros. That's not enough. So there's still room for a budget. My name is Ko. I'm a Romanian in Delbeek. A private acquaintance, Daniel van Bram, is already gone. I've been there before. We started with that. A Californian incentive. Stimulated. And that's going on. I used to sit with him. He's the biggest insurer in Brussels. He's in the whole bazaar. He's now set up four people. Financially. Per shift. He was working with two partners. That's Arbol and that's me. I know that there are A, B and C customers. That's not your customer. Of course. I have a lot of work to do. He was the founding chairman. So I had to do a lot of work. But Bram tried to do it too. But we also agree that you can buy that insurance again. I agree with him. In the same way as he describes the insurance. That we collect all of our own customers. That we are directly linked to them. So that's what we're doing. This is what we're doing for me. And that's what they're doing for me. M-Scope, wake up to the tree. M-Scope, wake up to the tree. M-Scope sees much more potential to do with us. With pricing and so on. We have to take care of that. That's ongoing. Lease Next is a new Dutch lease advisor. That I found. I'm going there next Tuesday. He has already crossed the border. I'm not going to attack him. No, that's optional. You can always go to sleep. I'm not a genius. I've been waiting for a long time. I asked him to combine it on Tuesday. We're going to DAF. No, that's a financial option. We're going to Paris. Me and Anthony on Friday. We have a meeting in the morning. And I-Lease. It's not DAF, it's optional. Yes, that's a new financing option. I'm going to take a look at it. That's another pot of money. We could have better arguments. I'm Michael. I think we were a good thing. We picked up a few people. Of course. Knowledge about banking. We had a good hour. September. The number of applications. They had a total of 65 applications per month. In September it was only 94. For me it's too rough to say. That's because of the actions I took. And again in September. A top month that there is an emergency. You don't know that. Those 94 applications could result in a million and 84 thousand euros. That's a huge amount of potential. What did we end up with? We had 21 color stones. 247 thousand euros. And among them 7 BN Profiles. 6 via PNR Coal. And 2 BN IRIES. And the rest were all 1ups. But is the reason that they are not picked up by us? Profiles make their own choices. We expect them not to go to the others. Because of the price. And also the fact that there is no personal money. We just mentioned that the closing ratio is a bit higher in September. Because you already have a pre-field training. Now the quality is a bit higher. And the quality is not as good as before. How do you think that will be? Time will tell. Depending on what you have done in December. The numbers are the same. But the sales dashboard will be completely different. We will ask for a different product type. For visa advisors and homos. And in the same time we will ask for a lifetime value. In December we will ask to see if there are any re-ups. And I will always have my numbers there. That's because of the deal source. That we have in the house. There are deals. There are deals that I have. With the budget training I told Pieter ... I apologize. Pieter said I will not give you my 2021. I said, what are you saying? I have a cool picture. Last year we had 76.2 million. In September we had 111.000.000. With 1.650.000. If we continue like this we will double our partnerships in 2024. And no one will have to worry about that we are now in the lead. But at the same time we are behind the budget. We are below 111.000.000. In September we had 145.000.000. We are ahead in euros. We all know why. But what we have in the budget I completely forgot. We were in ... The numbers of partnerships have increased by 52 machines. Until September In September we had 37. I have to name a few. Today we have 12 machines. Of those 12 machines there are 7 partnerships. The other 5 are more expensive. So we had that one after the other. And then a number of us ... It does not matter. It's just a budget. It's just that there are no machines.
that we want to be a little bit different, but we have to be in agreement with the other priorities. Do you want to compensate for that? That machine is not necessarily in the machine, I can do that with an extra effort, but I don't want it to be included, but I can include it. Rest year is 3 times 21. I think that's doable, but gradually, although the trend continues, during the 4-9 days of September, 4 or 5 of our partners are already in this country, I don't know. There is also an ageing, and that ageing is the same, I am now aware that it is 2-3-4 weeks, I have no idea, but I would like to prove now, also with this year, that it is not 20 months, because then you don't have to make a lot of effort, I think you have to put it in your budget, and you can just focus on making yourself free. And that is the last point, recruitment, and I have a question. What do you think about the recruitment tax in 2013, Thomas? What do you think? What do you think? You see that video? What do you say? How do you know that? Ah, I don't know, I don't know. Thomas had a question. I don't know. I don't know either. So I launched it, and next Monday, I have a very strong profile, I also had a party in Van Gogh for Jobs, for a lot of people, and I got a lot of questions. I also have invoices, so next Monday, there are a lot of people, I think, so next Monday, I will pick up Jules, who will come to me, and I will tell him what I want to do. But then there was a very big remark from a passenger, Stephanie, and it is funny, because in the middle of the road, but on the other side, there are a lot of hires, so there are 5,000 per week, 15,000 people for us at the moment. So I know a lot of people. And for whom is that? Then you have to be careful, because in the middle of the road, there are a lot of people. Has anyone seen a candidate who is coming today? Yes. Yes, okay. That was a temporary candidate. It was a 4-5. That is someone who is for sports. But 4-5, right? Yes, it was 4-5. But they were all hanging out. Okay, I didn't think it was bad. I already have a candidate. Okay, good. So you had a recruitment. I saw it at the time of the year. I am a running back myself. I am looking for a team. Just for us, yes. So I am looking for a project. Okay, good. Stefanie, where are we? Are we up there? Do I have to walk around myself? Instead of sitting? Yes. It would be nice if you could walk around yourself. I'm not going to do that. I've already done that. I'm not going to do that. You have to hang out with people. Yes, yes, yes. I didn't have to entertain myself. I didn't know what it was all about. I had already done that. I had something like that. It's for everyone. It's for everyone. Is there anyone in the room who can find the trimmer focus? That's what we're looking for. I don't think so. Maybe. I think it's worth it. I don't have a web profile. If you send the rest to me, I'll send you a web profile. I don't have that. I don't have that. But if you want to see what we're doing in our report, that's the first time we've talked about the number of new clients. So, that's enough for us to go down. If you're interested, you can take a look at the board. I was talking to a team about this month. We're going to say we're starting. I have a red one from 2042. I'm very convinced that you're also convinced. We've been talking about this for a while. In the beginning, I said we should stay away from this month. You didn't come this month. You were on the road. And your start of the month is closer to last month. Maybe we'll have to remember that. Maybe we'll have to forget about it. Maybe we'll have to make an extra plan. That was not the plan we had before. The budget is 32 million euros. That's one quarter of the month. That's 40. That's three quarters of the month. Maybe we'll have to remember that. So, that's September. As I said, the ratio is not bad. We had a much worse year than we had last year. As I said, this month and next month we're not talking about our budget. We had an output delivered. And next month we're talking about our budget. But we're talking about things where we can improve. And no ideals. And if you look at the budget, if you look at the budget, you'll see that we're not talking about TV. We're talking about TV. TV is an option. And LKW is a bit lower. No, no, no. 9.9 is even above our budget. I don't know if we have that. Yes, we do. I don't know if we have that. Do you know how you sell it? We sell it according to our budget. Sometimes in numbers. Because this is the fund. Yes, the sales are better because we have stock. Yes. What is the number of employees? It's right here. The membership. Partnerships. Maybe we'll talk about that later. I have other financial relationships. You can see it here. Every month, we have a package and a budget. And the other three pairs. I don't have that. I don't have that either. I don't have that either. There is a top month, with 20,000. It's here. Yes, it's here. Here, with Harber. It's about how we will connect with the partners. He is moving. I don't know if that's about taking actions. It has to do with proof of contract. It's 3 times 21. We will see. An existing business like I said, 11 instead of 14. From year to date. I don't know why it was there. If I understood it correctly, it says existing business but I don't know what it means. I don't know what I think is in there. With the contract, a package of 20,000 is in there. It has to do with momentum. It's a state-owned company and it's coming to the Netherlands. You can't expect that this month or next month. It has to do with momentum. You can't expect that this month or next month. You can't expect that this month or next month. That's it. Thank you. Thank you.
But you can't forget that in that first and second contract, you didn't know anything about the other one. What are the numbers? But we are such good brothers. I don't film shit anymore. I don't want to do that anymore. I don't want to do that anymore. But we know BKW in the game. That's why we're here. I don't want to do that anymore. I don't want to do that anymore. I don't want to leave. I don't want to leave. I'm just saying it.. Yes, we identified that. Doodle is not bad. This situation is great. But sketch is something new. Sketch is easy.
